###Methods
PET Plastic bottles were placed in three different stations (Dowsing, Gabbard, and Warp) in the North Sea (Fig 1), and were collected in different seasons (Spring, Summer, and Winter) by Dr. Sonja Oberbeckmann, IO-Warnemuende; and Dr. Melissa Duhaime, University of Michigan. DNA was extracted from the bottles and sequenced using Illumina sequencer. Sequence data was processed by Dr. Duhaime. I received OTU tables and sample data from Dr. Duhaime.

describe your general approach to analyzing the data



```{r, echo=FALSE}
otu.table <- read.table(file="PET_otutab.tsv", header=TRUE)
otu.taxa<-read.table (file="PET_otutable_taxa.tsv", header=TRUE)
sample.data<-read.table (file="PET_sample_data.tsv", header=TRUE)

library("phyloseq")
otu <- otu_table(otu.table, taxa_are_rows=TRUE) 
```




###Results
a summary of your results, 


###Discussion
 and mention of what your future directions would be.
